# 🔥 AI-Based Forest Fire Detection System

An intelligent system designed to detect forest fires using Artificial Intelligence and real-time data from sensors and/or satellite images. This project aims to reduce the impact of wildfires by enabling early detection and timely alerts.

## 🌲 Overview

Forest fires pose a major threat to biodiversity, climate, and human life. Traditional fire detection methods can be delayed or ineffective in remote regions. Our AI-based system uses machine learning and sensor data to provide an accurate, automated detection solution.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔍 **AI-powered image classification** to detect smoke and fire from satellite or camera feeds.
- 🌡️ **Sensor-based detection** using temperature, gas, and humidity sensors for real-time alerts.
- ☁️ **Cloud integration** for data storage and monitoring.
- 📱 **Mobile/web dashboard** for visualizing fire risk zones.
- 🚨 **Alert system** via SMS/email or app notification.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow / PyTorch / Scikit-learn
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV
- **IoT Sensors:** Temperature sensor (DHT11), Gas sensor (MQ-2), Flame sensor
- **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi / ESP32
- **Cloud Platform:** Firebase / AWS / ThingSpeak
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React (optional)
